# Architecture Overview

## 1. Frontend

The frontend is built using **Angular** and **TypeScript**. It consists of several key components:

- **Billing Form Component**: Handles the user input for billing information.
- **Transaction History Component**: Displays the history of user transactions.
- **Pages**: Includes Dashboard, Payments, and Subscriptions, which manage various parts of the UI.
- **Redux for State Management**: Global state management for handling payments and other app-wide states.
- **API Services**: Interacts with backend services such as payment processing.
- **Utility Modules**: Contains common utilities such as currency formatting and validators.
- **Global Styles**: Manages the global look and feel of the application.

## 2. Backend

The backend is built using **Python** and **Java**, with performance-critical components handled by Java:

- **Controllers**: Handle API requests for payments and subscriptions.
- **Models**: Define the schema for users and payments.
- **Routes**: Manage API routing for payments and subscriptions.
- **Services**: Business logic for payments and subscriptions.
- **Middlewares**: Handle authentication and request validation.
- **Utility Modules**: JWT handling, email services, and more.
- **Main Application**: Flask or Django server to manage requests and orchestrate services.

## 3. Database

The database layer uses **Python** for schema definitions and migrations:

- **Migrations**: Handles database versioning and table creation.
- **Models**: Define the structure of the database tables.
- **Seeds**: Prepopulate the database with necessary data.
- **Configuration**: Database connection settings.

## 4. Payment Processing

Payment integration with **Stripe** and **PayPal** using Python:

- **Gateways**: Interact with external payment processors.
- **Transaction Management**: High-performance transaction management handled by **Go**.
- **Refund Management**: Also managed by Go for performance.
- **Webhooks**: Listen and process incoming webhook events.

## 5. Billing and Invoicing

Handles subscription lifecycle, invoice generation, and billing schedules:

- **Subscription Manager**: Manages the lifecycle of subscriptions.
- **Invoice Generator**: Automatically creates invoices.
- **Billing Scheduler**: Schedules recurring billing cycles.
- **Tax Calculator**: Computes taxes based on location and other factors.

## 6. Security and Compliance

Ensures compliance with industry standards like **PCI-DSS**:

- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data encryption using industry best practices.
- **PCI Compliance**: Tools and audits to ensure PCI compliance.
- **Firewall**: Basic firewall configuration to ensure security at the network level.

## 7. Performance and Scalability

Performance is critical, so caching is implemented in **Go**, and load balancing is configured using **Python**:

- **Redis Caching**: Caching implementation using Redis.
- **Load Balancing**: Configured using NGINX.

## 8. Monitoring and Logging

Monitors system health and logs critical events:

- **Prometheus Metrics Exporter**: Written in Go, exports metrics to Prometheus.
- **Log Configuration**: Manages log outputs and levels.

## 9. Deployment and Infrastructure

The infrastructure is managed using **Kubernetes** and **Terraform**:

- **Kubernetes**: Manages containerized services and provides service discovery.
- **Terraform**: Handles provisioning of infrastructure, such as AWS S3.
